Provides a dummy implementation for sputchar that discards
input characters rather than writing them to the serial port.
Use:

  require "noserial.llc"

before the corresponding require for "wvram.llc" to turn off
simulataneous output to the screen and the serial port.

> require "core.llc"

> export sputchar :: Word -> Proc Unit
> sputchar c       = return Unit
